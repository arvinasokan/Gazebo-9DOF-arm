A 9DOF Robotic arm is built and simulated in the Gazebo simulation environment.The ACH IPC is used to interface the model plugin and the control code.
Note:
The following dependencies have to be installed for the code to work
i)   ACH IPC
ii)  HUBO-ACH 

An ACH channel by the name "my_channel" should be created everytime the code is executed.
The Arm Should be controlled using the Control.py code.
The ACH channel should be removed after each and every instance of the control code.
The ACH channel can be cleared using the following command 'ach rm my_channel'
